Don't require account, accept anon, save anon data in localstorage (persistant storage?)

WS server for question/answer dialogue
In ws connection, cache answers to questions, don't return them in response????
Questions load-ahead


on first connection to server: server creates CLIENT-ID
Create entry in database, create and save seed to shuffle question indexes.
client saves their ID to localstorage.
On next connection, connect to /ws/practice/{CLIENT-ID}
The session can be continued.



DB.Clients:
client_id --> uuid4
created_at --> datetime
is_anon --> bool, if user has created account, or its just anon-session
email --> text|null             }
name --> text|null               } --> null for anons
password --> text(bcrypt)|null  }
practice_seed --> int, used for shuffling indexes for practice
practice_index --> int, current practice question
practice_hard_questions --> list[int], if user answers incorrectly, append question index to this list. When in practice session, randomly insert questions from this list until user answers correctly
practice_saved_questions --> list[int], user can bookmark questions, append them to this list
